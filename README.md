- Hi, I am Bruno Lunardon (most people just call me Lunardon)
- I'm interested in many subjects but to be brief my main interest at the moment is to study subjects related to data science and all the mathematics behind it.  
- My main occupations at the moment are studying to get my degree, managing my college's academic center, and giving math classes to underprivileged students preparing for the ENEM (the Brazilian SAT).
- Currently my studies are focused on python and linear algebra
- If you wanna reach me just send me an email on lunardonbrunok@gmail.com
